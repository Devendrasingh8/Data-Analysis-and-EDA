After going through the analysis, here are some interesting findings:
1. Improvements should be done on same day of shipment mode
2. The company had alots of profits in copier but the number of sales is very less so there is a need to increase number of sales in copier.
3. The company is facing loss in two products such as bookcases and tables where the losses is more.
4. Office Supplies are excellent so we have to focus more on Technology and Furniture Category of business.
5. The company is facing loss in top 25 States as compared to lease economic states where the profits and sales are higher so nned to work more on least economic states.
6. When the profits of a state are compared with the discount provided in each state, the states which has allowed more discount, went in loss.

Thank you.
